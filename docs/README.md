## Installation

To install the project, run the following command:

```text
pip install python-sapcommissions
```

### REST API

This project mimics the usage of the SAP Commissions REST API. Visit
`https://{CALD}-{ENV}.callidusondemand.com/APIDocument` to read the full specification, replacing `CALD` with your
tenant name, and `ENV` with your environment name.

### Terminology

Things to keep in mind while reading the documentation.

| Keyword  | Description                                                                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Endpoint | A type of object that you can interact with, like `Participants` and `Positions`. |
| Method   | An action to perform on an endpoint, like `list()` and `get_id()`.                |
| Resource | An instance of an endpoint, like `Participant` and `Position`.                    |

## Usage

To get started, import `Connection` and an endpoint of your choosing. In this example, we'll use `Participants` as the
endpoint.

```py
from sapcommissions import Connection
from sapcommissions.endpoints import Participants
```

Initialize a Connection by providing the tenant, environment, username, and password. Optionally, you can disable ssl
verification, if you have problems connecting to the API from your corporate network.

```python
prod = Connection("CALD", "PRD", "MyUserName", "MySuperSecretPassword", verify_ssl=False)
```

We'll use the `Participants` endpoint to get a list of all participants in the environment. The `list()` method returns
a `generator`, to retrieve all `Participants`, you can convert the generator to a `list` or processes the `Participants`
one-by-one.

```py
# List all Participants
all_users = list(Participants(prod).list())

# Process Participants one-by-one
for participant in Participants(prod).list():
  ...  # Do something
```

## Endpoints

Endpoints are the objects you can interact with, like `Participants`, `Positions`, `Credits` or `Pipelines`. For a full
list of endpoints and their associated methods, please read the [Endpoints documentation](ENDPOINTS.md).

## Methods

Methods are the actions you can perform on an endpoint, like `list()`, `get()` and `create()`. You'll find links to the
associated methods in the [Endpoints documentation](ENDPOINTS.md). For a full list of available methods, please read the
[Methods documentation](METHODS.md).
